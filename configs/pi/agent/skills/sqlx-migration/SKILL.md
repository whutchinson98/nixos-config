# SQLx Migration

Use the SQLx CLI to create migration files instead of manually creating timestamped files.

## Instructions

1. Identify the project or crate root where SQLx migrations should live.
   - Prefer the directory that contains an existing `migrations/` directory.
   - If there are multiple crates/projects, ask the user which one unless the target is obvious.
2. Convert the requested migration description to a short snake_case name, for example `create_users_table`.
3. Run the SQLx CLI from the project root:

   ```bash
   sqlx migrate add name_of_migration
   ```

   Replace `name_of_migration` with the actual snake_case migration name.
4. Do not manually add timestamps or hand-create migration filenames; `sqlx migrate add` generates the correct timestamped file.
5. After the command succeeds, read the generated migration file and add the requested SQL changes there.
6. If `sqlx` is not installed or not on `PATH`, stop and tell the user to install `sqlx-cli` rather than manually creating the migration file.
